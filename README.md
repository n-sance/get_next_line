## What's that?

This projects is about creating a function that, allows to read a line ending with a newline character ('\n') 
from a file descriptor, without knowing its size beforehand. 
One of the goal of this project is to learn a highly interesting new concept in C programming: 
static variables, and to gain a deeper understanding of allocations, 
whether they happen on the stack memory or in the heap memory, 
the manipulation and the life cycle of a buffer, the unexpected 
complexity implied in the use of one or many static variables.


## How can I use it?

### First you need to compile it as following below:
Run the following commands:

*To compile  
  `make`  
*To remove objects:  
  `make clean`  
*To remove objects and binary file (program):  
  `make fclean`  
*To re-compile:  
  `make re`  
  
### Then executing:
To test the function, compile with main.c.

`gcc main.c src/get_next_line.c`  

`./a.out tests/some_lines.txt`  

If wanted to test with multiple file descriptors, compile with `main-multiple-fds.c`  

`gcc main-multiple-fds.c src/get_next_line.c`. 

`./a.out tests/some_lines.txt tests/nl_and_eof_one.txt`
